# Future Prospects

One thing for sure is to link the project with the API for cricket scoreboard, We are going through many tutorials to learn how to build API , and how functioning can be done through it. <br>
We will also try our best to include the fantasy cricket cricket for fans , that again requires API , so work would be done on that. <br>
The other things for the project prospects is welcomed by you, we will try our best to accomplish that.
